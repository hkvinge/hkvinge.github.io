I have been a contributor to a number of industry projects:

1. **Compressive Sensing Flash IR 3D Imager**: In collaboration with industrial partner, Physical Sciences Inc. we are developing a compact infrared flash 3D imaging sensor employing compressive sensing (CS) approaches. The single pixel architecture will enable significant size, weight, power, and cost reduction relative to emerging flash LADAR systems employing a high speed avalanche photodiode APD array. My major contributions to this project include:

- Developing techniques for choosing an optimal sampling basis.
- Designing and testing CS reconstruction algorithms.
- Implementing all algorithms and producing a software package for use in devices operating in the field.
