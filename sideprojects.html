        <p> During the winter of 2016 I became interested in data science and machine learning.
 I love pure math but have always been disspointed by its inability to cope with the messiness
of complicated real world processes. In data science I see much of the creative 
qualitative problem solving that I enjoyed in math, but within a framework where I can help find solutions for real world problems.
 The fact that data science is multidisciplinary is also a big plus for me, I have really enjoyed the chance to learn more about computer science and statistics.
 Finally, I am eager for the opportunity to work with a team of people coming from diverse backgrounds.

<p> My goal over the past year has been to get some pracical hands-on experience in data science. Below are two projects that I have worked on so far.

<ul style="margin-left: 12px; margin-right: 8px;">
    <li> <i><b> Using machine learning techniques to build a model which accurately predicts physician triage for patients 
    suffering from chronic asthma </i></b>
    <p> (for <a href="http://revonsystems.com/">Revon Systems, Inc</a>, under mentorship of chief data scientist Dr. Sumanth Swaminathan, July 2016)
    <p> Revon Systems is a start-up based in Louisville, Kentucky, which uses methods from machine learning to 
    help patients with chronic illnesses better manage their health. They do this through a platform which 
    can triage patients based on their current symptoms. Last summer Revon was interested in expanding their 
    platform to include patients with chronic asthma. Our problem was therefore the following: use machine 
    learning methods to create a mathematical model which accurately predicts physician triage for people 
    suffering from chronic asthma.
    <p>After spending 10 days wrangling the data given to us by Dr. Swaminathan and experimenting with various 
    learning algorithms, our model was able to achieve 86% accuracy predicting the physician triage on 
    non-training data.

<p>
This project what the capstone of the <a href="https://www.ima.umn.edu/2015-2016/SW6.20-7.29.16">Institute of Mathematics and its Applications Math-to-Industry Bootcamp</a>. 
</li>

<li> <i><b> Investigation of the effects of solar radiation and pollution on crop yield </i></b> (Davis Data Science Initiative, ongoing)
 <p> I am currently working with a team of graduate students at UC Davis, under the leadership of Matthew Espe, to try to understand whether air pollution has an effect on rice crop yields in CA.
 In order to do this we have had to pull and clean large amounts of data from a wide variety of government databases.
 We are just beginning an exploratory analysis of some of the preliminary data we have pulled.</p>
<p> Through this project I hope to learn and practice more steps in the data science pipeline. Eventually I plan to make some of my code available on this website.</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 12px; margin-right: 8px;">
    <li> <i><b> UC Davis Data Rescue </i></b> (Davis Data Science Initiative, Feb. 2 2016)
<p> I volunteered as a data scraper/harevester for a day to help preserve climate data on government websites. I wrote Python scripts to grab all PDF files found some specific NOAA websites.
