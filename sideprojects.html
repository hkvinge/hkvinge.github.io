        <p> Recently I have become interested in applications of mathematics to data science, in particular machine learning.
        Below are some mostly data science, projects that I have worked on (more to come). Eventually I hope to be able to contribute
        to machine learning at the level of theory.

    <li> <i><b> Using machine learning techniques to build a model which accurately predicts physician triage for patients 
    suffering from chronic asthma </i></b>
    <p> (for <a href="http://revonsystems.com/">Revon Systems, Inc</a>, under mentorship of chief data scientist Dr. Sumanth Swaminathan)
    <p> Revon Systems is a start-up based in Louisville, Kentucky, which uses methods from machine learning to 
    help patients with chronic illnesses better manage their health. They do this through a platform which 
    can triage patients based on their current symptoms. Last summer Revon was interested in expanding their 
    platform to include patients with chronic asthma. Our problem was therefore the following: use machine 
    learning methods to create a mathematical model which accurately predicts physician triage for people 
    suffering from chronic asthma.
    <p>After spending 10 days wrangling the data given to us by Dr. Swaminathan and experimenting with various 
    learning algorithms, our model was able to achieve 86% accuracy predicting the physician triage on 
    non-training data.
