        <p> During the winter of 2016 I became interested in data science and machine learning. I worked on a number of projects to get a feel for the area. When I started applying for postdoc positions, I focused on finding one where I could continue to study and work in this fascinating area while still staying connected to the world of math. In my present position I get to do just that. In the coming month I hope to summarize of some of the projects that I am now working on, which use both compressive sensing and machine learning to efficiently reconstruct images from a minimal number of measurements. Until then, I have included some projects that I worked on in my last year as a graduate student.

<h4><u> Projects</u> </h4>

<ul style="margin-left: 12px; margin-right: 8px;">
    <li> <i><b> Using machine learning techniques to build a model which accurately predicts physician triage for patients 
    suffering from chronic asthma </i></b>
    <p> (for <a href="http://revonsystems.com/">Revon Systems, Inc</a>, under mentorship of chief data scientist Dr. Sumanth Swaminathan, July 2016)
    <p> Revon Systems is a start-up based in Louisville, Kentucky, which uses methods from machine learning to 
    help patients with chronic illnesses better manage their health. They do this through a platform which 
    can triage patients based on their current symptoms. Last summer Revon was interested in expanding their 
    platform to include patients with chronic asthma. Our problem was therefore the following: use machine 
    learning methods to create a mathematical model which accurately predicts physician triage for people 
    suffering from chronic asthma.
    <p>After spending 10 days wrangling the data given to us by Dr. Swaminathan and experimenting with various 
    learning algorithms, our model was able to achieve 86% accuracy predicting the physician triage on 
    non-training data.

This project what the capstone of the <a href="https://www.ima.umn.edu/2015-2016/SW6.20-7.29.16">Institute of Mathematics and its Applications Math-to-Industry Bootcamp</a>. 
</li>

<li> <i><b> Investigation of the effects of solar radiation and pollution on crop yield </i></b> (Davis Data Science Initiative, ongoing)
 <p> During my last four months at UC Davis, I worked with a team of graduate students, under the leadership of Matthew Espe, to try to understand whether air pollution has an effect on rice crop yields in CA.
 In order to do this we had to pull and clean large amounts of data from a wide variety of government databases.
 Unfortunately, when I left we had only just begun exploratory analysis of some of the preliminary data we had pulled.</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 12px; margin-right: 8px;">
    <li> <i><b> UC Davis Data Rescue </i></b> (Davis Data Science Initiative, Feb. 2 2017)
<p> I volunteered as a data scraper/harevester for a day to help preserve climate data on government websites. I wrote Python scripts to grab all PDF files from some specific NOAA websites.
