        <p> During the winter of 2016 I became interested in data science and machine learning.
 I love pure math but was always somewhat disspointed by its inability to cope with the messiness
of complicated real world processes (there is a reason why math is so applicable to physics,
 which studies some of the simplest systems in nature (at least compared to a field like biology)). In data science I saw much of the creative 
qualitative problem solving that I enjoyed in math, but within a framework that was much more applicable
to problems in the real world. In the dabbling that I have also been excited by the wide variety of other domains of knowledge that come into play such as computer science for example. Finally, I am excited by the opportunity to work with people coming from diverse backgrounds.

<p> My goal over the past year has been to get some pracical hands-on experience in data science. Below are two projects that I have worked on so far.

<ul style="margin-left: 12px; margin-right: 8px;">
    <li> <i><b> Using machine learning techniques to build a model which accurately predicts physician triage for patients 
    suffering from chronic asthma </i></b>
    <p> (for <a href="http://revonsystems.com/">Revon Systems, Inc</a>, under mentorship of chief data scientist Dr. Sumanth Swaminathan)
    <p> Revon Systems is a start-up based in Louisville, Kentucky, which uses methods from machine learning to 
    help patients with chronic illnesses better manage their health. They do this through a platform which 
    can triage patients based on their current symptoms. Last summer Revon was interested in expanding their 
    platform to include patients with chronic asthma. Our problem was therefore the following: use machine 
    learning methods to create a mathematical model which accurately predicts physician triage for people 
    suffering from chronic asthma.
    <p>After spending 10 days wrangling the data given to us by Dr. Swaminathan and experimenting with various 
    learning algorithms, our model was able to achieve 86% accuracy predicting the physician triage on 
    non-training data.

This project what the capstone of the <a href="https://www.ima.umn.edu/2015-2016/SW6.20-7.29.16">Institute of Mathematics and its Applications Math-to-Industry Bootcamp</a>.
