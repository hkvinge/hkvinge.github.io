I am interested in geometric and topological data analysis, machine learning, compressive sensing, and applied optimization. In general, I am interested in techniques that extract the maximum amount of information from a high-dimensional, complex data set. 

My papers include:

1. **A GPU-oriented algorithm design for secant-based dimensionality reduction** (with Elin Farnell, Michael Kirby, and Chris Peterson) to appear in the Proceedings of the 17th IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (link coming soon).

2. **Endmember extraction on the Grassmannian** (with Elin Farnell, Michael Kirby, and Chris Peterson) to appear in the Proceedings of the 2018 IEEE Data Science Workshop.
