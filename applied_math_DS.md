I am interested in geometric and topological data analysis, machine learning, compressive sensing, and applied optimization. More generally I like developing techniques that extract the maximum amount of information from high-dimensional, complicated data sets. 

My papers include:

3. **Too many secants: Too many secants: a hierarchical approach to secant-based dimensionality reduction on large data sets** (with Elin Farnell, Michael Kirby, and Chris Peterson) accepted to IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference September 2018 (link coming soon).

2. **A GPU-oriented algorithm design for secant-based dimensionality reduction** (with Elin Farnell, Michael Kirby, and Chris Peterson) to appear in the Proceedings of the 17th IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (link coming soon).

1. **Endmember extraction on the Grassmannian** (with Elin Farnell, Michael Kirby, and Chris Peterson) to appear in the Proceedings of the 2018 IEEE Data Science Workshop.

In progress:

1. **Using dictionary learning to predict health outcomes** (with Elin Farnell, Michael Kirby, and Chris Peterson).
