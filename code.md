I am in the process of cleaning up code from various projects and moving it to Github. Expect more to appear here over the course of the next few months.

Below is code for some of our recent papers:

1. Code for **Endmember extraction on the Grassmannian**, (coming soon).

2. C++/CUDA code for **A GPU-oriented algorithm design for secant-based dimensionality reduction**, [Github page](https://github.com/hkvinge/Secant-avoidance-projection-algorithm)

3. Code for **Too many secants: a hierarchical approach to secant-based dimensionality reduction on large data sets**, (coming soon).

4. A [project](https://github.com/hkvinge/Classifying-telemetry-data-with-cnns/blob/master/README.md)
I did classifying human telemetry data using convolutional neural networks from TensorFlow 
(the data used in this project can be found at [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Activity+Recognition+from+Single+Chest-Mounted+Accelerometer).
