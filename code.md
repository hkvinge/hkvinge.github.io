Some code associated with old projects.

1. Code for **Endmember extraction on the Grassmannian**, (coming soon).

2. C++/CUDA code for **A GPU-oriented algorithm design for secant-based dimensionality reduction**, [Github page](https://github.com/hkvinge/Secant-avoidance-projection-algorithm)

3. Code for **Too many secants: a hierarchical approach to secant-based dimensionality reduction on large data sets**, (coming soon).

4. A [project](https://github.com/hkvinge/Classifying-telemetry-data-with-cnns/blob/master/README.md)
I did classifying human telemetry data using convolutional neural networks from TensorFlow 
(the data used in this project can be found at [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Activity+Recognition+from+Single+Chest-Mounted+Accelerometer).
