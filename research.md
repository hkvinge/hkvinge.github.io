## Data science and applied math

![illumination_space](Pumpkin_Proj_SAP_Reel1ColorPCA.png)

I am interested in geometric and topological data analysis, machine learning, compressive sensing, and applied optimization. More generally I like developing techniques that extract the maximum amount of information from high-dimensional, complicated data sets. I am particularly interested in:

* Dimensionality reduction algorithms
* Anomaly detection and other techniques for monitoring large data sets
* Adapting machine learning algorithms designed for Euclidean space to other manifolds, particularly Grassmannians, flag manifolds, and compact Lie groups.

See my [publications page](publications.md) for a list of my papers. 

## Representation theory and combinatorics

![Heisenberg category_eq](diagramimage3.png)

I work on problems related to representation theory, algebraic Lie theory, algebraic combinatorics, and categorification. These days I am especially interested in:

* Symmetric groups and related Hecke algebras,
* Symmetric functions,
* Quantum groups and crystal combinatorics,
* Connections between representation theory and probability theory.

See my [publications page](publications.md) for a list of my papers.
