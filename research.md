## Data science and machine learning

I am interested in machine learning. In particular, the use of tools from pure mathematics to enable new frameworks, algorithmic architectures, and general approaches to machine learning prroblems. I am especially interested in:

* Geometric deep learning, 
* Few-shot learning,
* Computer vision
* Applications of representation to machine learning
* The use of sheaves and other topological constructions in machine learning,
* Compressive sensing, 
* Dimensionality reduction,
* The use Grassmann and related manifolds as frameworks for machine learning problems.

See my [publications page](publications.md) for a list of my papers. 


## Representation theory and combinatorics

I used to work on problems related to representation theory, algebraic Lie theory, algebraic combinatorics, and categorification:
