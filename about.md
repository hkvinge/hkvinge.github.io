I am a data scientist at Pacific Northwest National Lab. Prior to this I was postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Mathematics at Colorado State University where I worked with the [Pattern Analysis Lab](https://sites.google.com/a/rams.colostate.edu/pattern-analysis-lab/). I graduated with a PhD in mathematics from UC Davis in June 2017. My advisor was [Monica Vazirani](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~vazirani/).

- As a graduate student I worked on problems related to representation theory, algebraic combinatorics, and categorification. 

- As a postdoc I worked at the interface of data science and mathematics. In particular: compressive sensing, geometric data analysis, applications of geometry and representation theory to machine learning, and data visualization.

- These days I mostly think about how to bring methods from "pure mathematics" to bear on problems in machine learning and data science.
