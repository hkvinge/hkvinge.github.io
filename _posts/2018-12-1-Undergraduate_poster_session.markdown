On December 6th we will be having a poster session here at Colorado State University where undergraduates will be presenting research on topics related to math. 
It should be a lot of fun. 
Four students from my 'Advanced calculus' (I think it is better described as an intro real analysis course) will be presenting interesting projects. 
Yujia Chen and Jingya Li will be presenting a poster for a [project](https://github.com/hkvinge/CSU-low-res-face-recognition) that they have been working on for the last few months which investigates linear algebra based algorithms for facial recognition. 
Laura Nolt will be presenting a poster for a [project](https://github.com/lauranolt1/Image-Reconstruction) where she studied how a "smart" change of basis can allow us to reduce the size of an image without losing a significant amount of the information that we care about in the image. 
Finally, Joshua de Jong will be presenting a poster in which he explains some of the basics of representation theory (particularly character theory).

Location: North Ballroom of the LSC
Time: 9:30-12:00, December 6th.
