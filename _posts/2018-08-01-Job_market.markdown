This fall I am going to start looking for a new position for July 2019.
 I will be looking both for tenure track positions in math and 
computer science departments and industry positions in machine learning 
and data science with a significant research component. I am 
most interested in positions in the Western US. If you have an opportunity
which matches my skill set, feel free to email me.
