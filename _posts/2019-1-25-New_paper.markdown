We just submitted a new paper, 'Rare geometries: revealing rare categories via dimension-driven statistics', 
to an upcoming machine learning conference. The idea of the paper is to use the *kappa*-profile, 
a rich geometric statistic, to classify unlabeled sets of points.
The thought is that even if two classes are not separable in the available features,
they often have other geometric properties that can distinguish them.
The *kappa*-profile can often detect these differences and use them
to estimate which class an unlabeled point belongs to.


Here is a link to the arXiv preprint (coming soon) and here is a link to the code on GitHub (coming soon).
