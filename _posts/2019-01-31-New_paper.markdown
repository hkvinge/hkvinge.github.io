We just submitted a new paper, 'A walk through spectral bands: Using virtual reality to better visualize hyperspectral data', 
to the 13th International Workshop on Self-Organizing Maps and Learning Vector Quantization, Clustering and Data Visualization. 
I have been thinking a lot about how virtual reality (VR) can be used to better understand high-dimensional data.
After all, we have pretty good software in our brains for making sense of not just the 2-dimensions that we see on the page,
but also things that we can experience in 3-dimensions. As hyperspectral data is inherently 3-dimensional, as also 
challenging to analyze, it seems reasonable to try to understand it in VR. The preliminary results (as reported in  the paper)
are that VR is a very promising tool for this application. Below is a picture of the Indian Pines data set as viewed in VR.

I will try to get this on the ArXiv soon.
