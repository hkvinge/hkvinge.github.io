I have submitted a new paper to the ArXiv, "[Coherent systems of probability measures on graphs for representations of free Frobenius towers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11555)." The idea is to try to understand how to generalize
 a framework encountered frequently in asymptotic representation theory where one has a sequence of
 probability measures on gagets that index the simple representations of a tower of algebras and which respect certain down/up transition functions.
This is called a *coherent system*. A frequently encountered example of this is given by Plancherel measures on Young's lattice with down/up transition functions defined via induction and restriction functors applied to simple representations of symmetric groups.

It turns out that what one needs for a similar construction to work for a more general tower of algebras is for induction and restriction to be biadjoint functors. 
Thus the correct setting to work in is a tower of algebras in which each algebra is the 
Frobenius extension of the one below it (a Frobenius tower). 
If we addtionally make some freeness assumptions between the algebras, 
the formulas for the down/up transition probabilities are quite nice.
Interestingly, we do not need to make any assumptions about the semisimplicity
of our algebras and when the algebras are not semisimple then we actually get
two coherent systems: one in which up transition is controlled by dimensions of
simples and down transition is controlled by dimensions of indecomposable projectives
and one in which the opposite is true. 

Finally, for one of these choices of coherent system, we can find two families of central elements which are essentially moments for the corresponding up and down transitions measures.
