We (Can Ozan Oguz, Michael Reeks, and myself) are about to put a new paper on the ArXiv. We study the center of the twisted Heisenberg category (since this is a diagrammatic category, this is by definition the algebra of closed diagrams), and show that it is isomorphic to a subalgebra of the symmetric functions generated by odd power sums.

Most intriguingly for me, most of the connections to asymptotic representation theory and probability theory that I found when studying the center of the non-twisted Heisenberg category carry over to the twisted case. Now though, the graphi that carries the Markov process is not Young's graph but rather the Schur graph (the graph of all **strict** partitions). 

As soon as the paper posts to the ArXiv, I will add a link.
