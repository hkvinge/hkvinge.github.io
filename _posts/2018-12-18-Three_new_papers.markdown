My collaborators Elin Farnell, Michael Kirby, and Chris Peterson have had three new abstracts accepted to the conference *SPIE: Defense + Commericial Sensing*. These include:

1. *More chemical detection through less sampling: amplifying chemical signals in hyperspectral data cubes through compressive sensing*
2. *A data-driven approach to sampling matrix selection for compressive sensing*
3. *Total Variation vs L1-regularization: A Comparison of Compressive Sensing Optimization Methods for Chemical Detection*
