Our paper *Monitoring the shape of weather, soundscapes, and dynamical systems:
 a new statistic for dimension-driven data analysis on large data sets*' (ArXiv link to be included shortly) has been accepted as a 
short paper for IEEE Big Data 2018 in Seattle, Washington. I will be giving a short
 talk about the use of the kappa-profile of a data set to better understand its intrinsic properties. 
More details to come!
