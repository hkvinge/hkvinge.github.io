        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>I study representation theory with a focus on the interplay between symmetric groups, Hecke algebras, and their generalizations on the one hand and algebraic structures from Lie theory on the other. One of the major themes of representation theory in the last 20 years has been the surprisingly broad connections between these two worlds. These connections are traditionally understood through various constructions in algebraic geometry and topology. However, in the most general setting (for example outside of finite type) geometry is often not available. 
<p>
An alternative algebraic/combinatorial approach interprets the connection between Hecke algebras and Lie theory through the lens of categorification, a program initiated by Frenkel and Crane  which aims to find category-theoretic analogs of set-theoretic structures. In this context the Hecke algebras and their relatives appear in the morphism spaces of the categories which control the algebraic structures from Lie theory. In my research I investigated two important components of this story. Ultimately my goals are: to gain a better understanding of the representation theory on both the Lie-theoretic and Hecke sides of the picture and to discover the fundamental combinatorial structures that appear at the intersection of these two worlds.</p>

    <li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04182"><i>Categorifying the tensor product of the Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystal B^(1,1) and a fundamental crystal</i></a> (with Monica Vazirani) 
    <p>
    We use Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier (KLR) algebras to categorify a crystal isomorphism between a fundamental crystal and the tensor product of a Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystal and another fundamental crystal, all in affine type. The nodes of the Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystal correspond to a family of "trivial" modules. The nodes of the fundamental crystal correspond to simple modules of the corresponding cyclotomic KLR algebra. The crystal operators correspond to socle of restriction and behave compatibly with the rule for tensor product of crystal graphs.</li>
    <li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04571"><i>Khovanov's Heisenberg category, moments in free probability, and shifted symmetric functions</i></a> (with Anthony Licata and Stuart Mitchell)
    <p>
    We establish an isomorphism between the center of the Heisenberg category defined by Khovanov and the algebra of shifted symmetric functions defined by Okounkov-Olshanski. We give a graphical description of the shifted power and Schur bases of the shifted symmetric functions as elements of the center, and describe the curl generators of the center in the language of shifted symmetric functions. This latter description makes use of the transition and co-transition measures of Kerov and the noncommutative probability spaces of Biane.</li>
