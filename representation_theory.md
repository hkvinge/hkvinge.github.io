title: Rep. theory and combinatorics
permalink: /rep_theory/

I work on problems related to representation theory, algebraic combinatorics, and categorification. I am especially interested in:

* Symmetric groups and related Hecke algebras,
* Symmetric functions,
* Quantum groups and crystal combinatorics,
* Connections between representation theory and probability theory.
