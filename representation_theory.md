I work on problems related to representation theory, algebraic Lie theory, algebraic combinatorics, and categorification. These days I am especially interested in:

* Symmetric groups and related Hecke algebras,
* Symmetric functions,
* Quantum groups and crystal combinatorics,
* Connections between representation theory and probability theory.
 
My papers include:

1. **The center of the twisted Heisenberg category, factorial Schur Q-functions, and transition functions on the Schur graph** (with Can Ozan Oguz and Michael Reeks) [ArXiv:1712.09626](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09626).

2. **Khovanov's Heisenberg category, moments in free probability, and shifted symmetric functions** (with Anthony Licata an Stuart Mitchell), Submitted ([arXiv:1610.04571](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04571)).<br/><br/>Extended abstract in Sem. Lothar. Combin. 78B (2017), Art. 63, 12pp (Conference proceedings from FPSAC 2017).

3. **A Combinatorial Categorification of the Tensor Product of the Kirillov-Reshetikhin Crystal B^{1,1} and a Fundamental Crystal** (with Monica Vazirani) Algebras and Representation Theory (2017) pp 1-55. ([arXiv:1508.04182](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04182)).<br/><br/>Extended abstract in DMTCS proc. BC, 2016, 719-730 (Conference proceedings from FPSAC 2016).
