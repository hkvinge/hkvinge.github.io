title: Rep. theory and combinatorics
permalink: /rep_theory/
---

I work on problems related to representation theory, algebraic Lie theory, algebraic combinatorics, and categorification. These days I am especially interested in:

* Symmetric groups and related Hecke algebras,
* Symmetric functions,
* Quantum groups and crystal combinatorics,
* Connections between representation theory and probability theory.
 
My papers include:

1. *The center of the twisted Heisenberg category, factorial Schur Q-functions, and transition functions on the Schur graph* (with Can Ozan Oguz and Michael Reeks) To appear.
2. *Khovanov's Heisenberg category, moments in free probability, and shifted symmetric functions* (with Anthony Licata an Stuart Mitchell)i, Submitted ([arXiv:1610.04571](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04571)).
3. *A Combinatorial Categorification of the Tensor Product of the Kirillov-Reshetikhin Crystal B^{1,1} and a Fundamental Crystal* (with Monica Vazirani) Algebras and Representation Theory (2017) pp 1-55.
