### Undegraduate research

Undergraduate research is important to me. 

- I am currently working with math majors Jingya Li and Yujia Chen on a face recognition [project](https://github.com/hkvinge/CSU-low-res-face-recognition). 
Here is a poster that they recently presented at the CSU undegraduate math fair [poster](face_recognition.pdf). 

- I also worked with Laura Nolt on a [project](https://github.com/lauranolt1/Image-Reconstruction) related to image processing.
See the associated [poster](Image_reconstruction_project.pdf).

- Finally, one of my students Joshua de Jong produced a really nice poster introducing [category theory](Poster_deJong.pdf).
